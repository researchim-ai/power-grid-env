# power-grid-env

[Русский](README.md)

![Industrial substation and plant with a neural-network graph over the equipment](docs/assets/power-grid-env-banner.jpg)

An engineering testbed for distribution-grid control algorithms. The first release is a quasi-static unbalanced feeder: import, preflight, an external controller, a restoration suite, comparison with a baseline, a report, and replay.

The simulator runs locally. A cluster, Kubernetes, and control of a real network are outside this project.

A simulation run is not permission to operate a real network, a real-time guarantee, or a full EMT study.

## What is numerically checked, and what is only implemented

Statuses live in `power_grid_env/capabilities.py`.

Checked numerically on authored cases, without field recordings:

- phase-domain power flow through OpenDSSDirect / DSS-Extensions: lines, `Dyn11` and `YNd11` transformers, ZIP loads, faults, an island with no source, and Kron reduction only when the neutral is explicitly solidly grounded;
- DSS import of the 110/10/0.4 kV plant: two infeeds, LineCode, capacitor, generator, storage, PV, a load profile, and Redirect;
- the positive-sequence ladder of that plant matches phase-domain OpenDSS to better than 1e-5 pu in magnitude;
- symmetric Newton AC power flow and a local AC OPF with a branch-flow limit;
- a classical machine, two machines, a first-order field voltage, and governor droop;
- RL/RLC transients and a dt versus dt/2 step check;
- DC power flow, PTDF, and linear WLS on small cases.

Implemented and exercised by scenarios, without a `validated_for_declared_scope` claim: restoration, interlocks, Gymnasium, LLM tools, a VLM canvas, and a local AC OPF. Distance and differential protection, full EMT, and hardware-in-the-loop stay outside this release.

Requirements: [specification](AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC_RU.md) and [architecture plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_RU.md), both in Russian. If they disagree, the specification wins. Equations and assumptions: [docs/physics](docs/physics/conventions.md).

## Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Python 3.11+ and the `dss-python` / `opendssdirect.py` wheels are required.

## Commands

```bash
power-grid import --source cases/acceptance/feeder_north/feeder.dss \
  --sidecar cases/acceptance/feeder_north/pge-import.yaml \
  --out /tmp/feeder.json --report /tmp/import.json

power-grid preflight /tmp/feeder.json --report /tmp/preflight.json

power-grid suite cases/suites/restoration_v1.yaml --out reports/acceptance

power-grid validate
power-grid accept
power-grid schemas --out /tmp/pge-schemas
power-grid pilot cases/industrial/plant --out /tmp/pilot.json
```

`validate` writes `reports/validation`. `accept` repeats the section 16–20 acceptance path: an external DSS case, rejection of an incomplete file, subprocess controllers, the suite, HTML, checksums, the viewer, replay, numerical checks, and a short Gymnasium rollout.

An external controller is a separate process speaking JSON lines (`initialize`, `reset`, `act`, `close`). Examples live in `examples/controllers`. The subprocess does not isolate the filesystem or the network of untrusted code.

## Model

Canonical JSON does not invent grounding or a vector group. DSS import requires a sidecar; otherwise a wye winding is not treated as grounded, and `r1/x1` are not turned into a phase-impedance matrix. The format choice is recorded in [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-import-format.md).

In the restoration task the damaged section is known to the algorithm. Fault impedance, the future load profile, and the scenario's hidden marker stay out of the observation.
